Limitations of Li-Fi
	Internet cannot be accessed without a light source. This could limit the locations and situations in       which Li-Fi  could be used.
	It requires a near or perfect line-of-sight to transmit data
	Opaque obstacles on pathways can affect data transmission
	Natural light, sunlight, and normal electric light can affect the data transmission speed
Conclusion	
Li-Fi is the most ideal solution for effective data transmission due to its basic building block : Light. Inexhaustible, accurate, fast, safe and cost effective, Li-Fi could potentially be the successor of Wi-Fi upon further development. Its working centers around the principle of varying the electrical signal based on the required output. Its applications range widely from toys to communication and can find uses in critical fields like military and medicine. Further research on Li-Fi is gaining pace in the recent times which will potentially resolve the many unsolved mysteries of the world.
